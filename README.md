Project Overview

The goal of the DriverPass project was to create a web-based system for DriverPass, a client that provides DMV test preparation and driving education services.  Building a comprehensive, safe, and expandable platform that allows student drivers to sign up, book driving lessons, take online exams, and monitor their progress was the aim.  Students, teachers, secretaries, and administrators were among the several user roles that the system had to accommodate. It also required to have a responsive interface that was usable on desktop and mobile devices.

As part of the coursework, I developed two key documents:

Project One: Business Requirements Document

Project Two: System Design Document

These documents demonstrate my ability to analyze client needs and propose technical solutions that meet functional and nonfunctional requirements.


Reflection

What did you do particularly well?

I outlined the system's functional and nonfunctional needs in detail.  I also described how the system would function safely in a cloud-based setting and put role-based access restrictions into place.  The business requirements document's organization and lucidity provided a solid basis for the design stage.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would enhance the UML diagrams by including more thorough interaction flows in the activity and sequence diagrams. I would employ more detailed user stories in subsequent revisions to make sure each visual accurately depicts edge cases and real-world situations.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

In order to pinpoint issues like ineffective scheduling and poor communication, I used interview transcripts and client goals.  Requirements including alarm systems, progress monitoring, and automated appointment scheduling were influenced by these observations.  Because it guarantees that the system addresses the real issues users encounter and promotes greater adoption and satisfaction, taking user demands into account is essential.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In order to envision the system, I first collect comprehensive requirements through documentation or interviews, then proceed to user story mapping and UML modeling. To increase design correctness and responsiveness, I would apply agile approaches, iterative prototyping, and user feedback loops early in the process in future projects.
